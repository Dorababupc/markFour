        <p>
         I started it very very late.I don't know about web development more, what i know is only some html and nothing else.</p>
         <p>Even i know that it's not possible for me to complete all the tasks in short time, i felt of leaving it, but when i went through one of the video of the Tanay sir i felt that even if i couldn't complete all the tasks, atleast i can learn something.</p>
        <p> I started slowly understanding how to link the html with the javascript ,which i never did before.It's really an amazing experience to see our work readily on the screen.</p>
       <p>So, seeing vidoes and trying out the tasks i found that almost i completed all the tasks except for a few.So i did really work hard in the last 3-4 days to complete the reamining also and did them.Actually i shouldn't say i worked hard, because i feel that this 3-4 days will be the best learning days of my life in my software career.</p>
   
        <p>I will try my level best to get into levelOne.By any mistake if i couldn't get into it atleast i hope to follow the course if the structure is realesed</p>
        <p>Finally, hoping to be a part of a great community of web developers soon.</p>
